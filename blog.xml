**  Integrate your Circuit Design Flow and Reports: Demonstration of Ngspice and Octave/Matlab Interaction within Emacs

by Tiago Oliveira Weber 2016-08-04 Thu


Can you imagine being able to explore new design ideas, perform calculations, run circuit simulations, calculate some more based on the results and generate reports, all in the same place? Well, you can stop imagining and start developing your next electric/electronic project on Emacs. 

Recently, I've made a ob-spice, which is a simple language extension to ob-babel to be able to simulate Ngspice within Emacs. In the present post I will show how we can use ob-spice to perform interaction between Ngspice, Octave (or Matlab) and any other language of our interest. While the experienced org-mode user would already assume this interaction possible from ob-babel features, it is the first demonstration of ob-spice receiving vector inputs (a new feature to ob-spice) and producing outputs back to other languages.

In our example we will design a simple opamp inverting topology. For that purpose, we will calculate the resistor values in Octave/Matlab, pass the values to Ngspice and measure the results so they can be used back in Octave/Matlab to calculate the error between the ideal response and the simulated one. The error will be due to the opamp characteristics and limitations (for th<a href= "http://tiagoweber.github.io/blog/entry4.html"> [... Read more]</a> </description>

**  Design Automation Conferece (DAC) Video About Moving EDA Tools to Open Source
by Tiago Oliveira Weber 2016-07-06 Wen

The DAC TV channel with the title "Lanza’s Tech Vision Challenge: Daring to Move to Open Source". The moderator was Lucio Lanza (from Lanza TechVentures) and the panelists were Warran Savage (from IP Extreme), Mark Templeton (from Scientific Ventures) and Michael Wishart (from eFabless).

In my opinion all participants were very rational on their statements although having different points of view. I, as an open source advocate, felt very glad this type of discussion is taking place in such a relevant conference and with people that know from the inside out how the current EDA business works.

**  Software/Hardware Integration Lab
by Tiago Oliveira Weber 2016-06-27 Mon

I am now a member of the *Software/Hardware Integration Lab* (LISHA) at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. According to the official site:

The Software/Hardware Integration Lab (LISHA) was founded in 1985 to promote research in the frontiers between hardware and software. Since then, it has dedicated considerable efforts to research in areas such as computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks and the related applications. Currently, the laboratory focuses on innovative techniques and tools to support the development of embedded systems.

My webpage at LISHA is https://lisha.ufsc.br/Weber and the announcement (in portuguese) of the start of LISHA at UFSC Araranguá is here.
